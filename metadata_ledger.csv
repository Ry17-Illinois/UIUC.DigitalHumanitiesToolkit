Urbana, Ill., Oct. 30, 1903

Professor J. H. Swan
Monmouth College
Monmouth, Ill.

Dear Professor Swan:

Your letter to Professor Palmer has been handed to me. 
I find it difficult to answer the questions.

The work in Household Science is elective, as are the other 
University courses, and is planned to cover four years of Univer- 
sity work. Only a small part of the work is done in our class 
rooms.

In Course 4, ""Chemistry of Food and Nutrition"", the girls are 
expected to have had two years of Chemistry, including work in food 
analysis— one semester of Chemistry, as well as Bacteriology
and Physiology, before beginning their work in this course.

In Course 1, Principles of the Selection and Preparation of 
Food"", we require a year each of high school chemistry and physics.

The courses are both lecture and laboratory studies. The 
catalogs and circulars will show you in general the outline of the 
work, as well as a few of the books of reference.

Hoping you may find the information you need either in this 
letter or in the literature,

I am,

Sincerely yours,

[signature]
Head of Department.

Mrs. Mary Hinman Abel
      C/o Professor Abel
          Johns Hopkins University
              Baltimore, Md.

Dear Mrs. Able:

    I have what may seem to you a very strange request to 
present.

    The ladies of the State Domestic Science Association wish to
secure a speaker for their session in the annual meeting of the
Farmers' Institute, to be held in Decatur, Illinois, February 
23-4-5.
I felt strongly inclined to urge them to secure your services for
the occasion, if possible, but it seemed to them it might be wiser
to find out first if you would consider such a proposition; hence
this letter.

    The meeting is held in a public hall, the Opera House, and the
audience is composed of all classes and conditions of people, -
farmers and their wives, society women, school teachers, lawyers, 
merchants, etc. The audience varies from five hundred to two thou-
sand. I am giving these details regarding the setting that you 
may better adapt yourself to conditions. I shall be glad to know 
how you feel about it, and the probable expense, if you come.

    Of course I am much interested in seeing you as well as hearing
you. Home Economics is still booming in this region.

                            Sincerely yours,

                            [Illegible Name]

Dear Miss Parloa:

I am much interested in finding out your whereabouts, both 
fcr my own sake and for that of sone other people. You know I have 
always hoped that I could find some attraction strong enough to bring 
you west. I have been asked if you would consider coming to the 
Farmers' Institute for their annual meeting to make an afternoon 
address, which shall be the address for that afternoon. The State 
Domestic Science Association is always given an afternoon at this 
annual meeting. The meetings are held in the opera house and 
you may have a crowd of two or three thousand people. I should 
be glad to know how you feel about making an address on such an 
occasion. 

The time is February 3-4-5. The ladies are really anxious 
to have you come and have asked me to find out if you would be will- 
ing to consider the proposition; also about the probable expenses. 
Hoping for a prompt and favorable reply, and with many good 
wishes, 

I am, 

Sincerely yours,

[Signature]

Mrs. Mae Chapman  
Vienna, Ill.  

Dear Madam:  

Your request concerning the Farmers’ Institute at Vienna has been received.  

As I spoke in Cairo only last week and was obliged to be away from my classes I do not feel that it would be advisable for me to go to Vienna on November 12. I can, however, send some one to take Mrs. Dunlap’s place on your program. Miss Z. C. Sprague has been with us as assistant in meat investigations and will do some institute work for us this year. She is thoroughly familiar with the work of the department and can speak to you either on “Domestic Science”, “Ideals in Bread and Bread-making”, or “Cooking of Meats”. Kindly tell us at your convenience whether you wish her services and which of these subjects you prefer. Expenses, as you know, of Farmers’ Institute work are for traveling and maintenance.  

Sincerely yours,

Can I secure from you Bulletin No. 50, on “The Composition of Maizes”, and any other bulletin on corn?  
I read with interest of your feeding experiments.

Mr. Francis C. Moore, President
Continental Insurance Co.
New York City

Dear Sir:

For two years you have done our students the favor of giving them your little book on ""How to Build a Home"". I have hesitated about asking continuance of the favor and yet I know it is so much appreciated. I suppose the purpose may have been to introduce the book and this may seem to you an abuse of the favor. I have not intended it so; but there are many demands upon the students for their rather limited supply of money and so I feel if you are willing to continue the favor it will be much appreciated. If you are not, at least you have done more than could be expected already. My class numbers 36 this year.

I state these facts and wish you to feel perfectly free in the kind of response you make.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sirs:

We are interested in having our students become familiar
with the uses of corn products in the home, and would like to ask if
you would be willing to send us samples of your various corn pre-
parations. We would wish to secure enough corn flour to have our
classes use it in bread making, - fifteen to twenty pounds. If
this seems too large a ""sample"" will you kindly give us the price
of your products? We should like any literature that you may have
on the subject of your processes of preparation, or other literature
telling of your work.

A prompt reply will greatly oblige,

Sincerely yours
